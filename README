This is a simple syntax for noweb. Basically, it is a nice way to view code and documentation with separate syntax highlighting. Also, it can autofold code blocks.

The script uses the following options:

noweb_backend
noweb_language
noweb_fold_code

Set noweb_backend to the basename of the syntax file you want to use, minus the \".vim\" extension. So, for TeX, you would:

let noweb_backend = \"tex\"

noweb_language is similar, but is used to highlight the contents of code blocks. So, for example:

let noweb_language = \"cpp\"

Makes the syntax for code snippets = C++.

Finally, there is noweb_fold_code, which sets whether or not code blocks should be automatically folded. If 1, then they will be folded. Otherwise, not.
